# Unicamp 2014 First Semester
This project has some projects from 2014 first semester from Computer Science Unicamp.
I did an effort to keep them organized so other students can possibly use them as a reference
Here we have:
* MC302 - Object-oriented Programming
* MC404 - Computers Organization and Assembly Languages
* MC458 - Project and Analysis of Algorithms
